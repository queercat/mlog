<p>the end comes soon. we hear drums, drums in the deep. they are coming. three rings for the elven-kings under the sky,</p>
<p>seven for the dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, nine for mortal men doomed to die, one for the dark lord on his dark throne</p>
<p>in the land of mordor where the shadows lie. one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</p>
<p>in the land of mordor where the shadows lie.</p>
<h2>in conclusion</h2>
<p>we will die and that is okay :)</p>
